# SM_Industries  
This forms an essential part of the following mods. SM Armory, SM Marine, SM AFV's, LargeBoatParts, SM ASW, SM OST and T, SM Stryker, NED
SM Mods localisation , Category creation and PaintShop for all SM Managed and owned KSP mods 

To use in combination with any of the forenamed KSP Mods place one (1) copy of the SMIndustries folder withing your GameData folder.

It is now a requirement that SM_Industries is used alongside the forenamed mods, it is not an optional feature 
This work provides the larger part of the EN_US localisation and will be added to as other managed mods are in turn processed for localisation .  Failure to use 1 copy of this dictionary in combination with the above named KSP mods will result in descriptions and titles being rendered as meaningless strings 


The bulk of the dictionary work was created and assembled by @gomker, using a combination of scripts in order to process such a large amount of individual parts .
